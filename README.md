Oil company wells analysis

We work at OilyGiant mining company. Our task is to find the best place for a new well. We were provided with 3 datasets of 3 different regions: df_1, df_2, df_3.

Our plan:

To collect the oil well parameters in the selected region: oil quality and volume of reserves;

To build a model for predicting the volume of reserves in the new wells;

To pick the oil wells with the highest estimated values;

To pick the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells.
